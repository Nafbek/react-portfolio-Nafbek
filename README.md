# React Portfolio-Nafbek

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed for showcasing my portfolio. It shows a brief summary of my expertise, list of projects, and a contact form to send messages to me. This web application is built using React, HTML, and bootstrap and custom CSS frameworksjs.

## Installation

Clone the repository, and open the root directory of the application on your terminal. To do so, make sure you have Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm) installed on your local machine. Afterwords, run a command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies such as bootstrap, react, and react-dom, and then start the server using a command `npm start` to open the application.

## Usage

The `About Me` section serves as a home page of the application, from where you can navigate to the other pages. In the portfolio page, you find a list of projects with links to the `GitHub` repository and `deployed site`. Hovering over each project will reveal the links. For any enquiries or messages, use the contact form in the `Contact` page.

You can follow the link below to navigate the application.
